    <p>Hi,<br> 
        My name is Furkan. I am passionate for AI, especially for computer vision. I improve myself on these fields with projects
        and online courses given by the best course platforms around the world like Coursera , EdX and Udacity. 
        You can see my certificates and GitHub profile in my CV. 
        <br>
        I did two internships on Computer Vision field and I continue to work with one of them as a Part-Time Machine Learning Engineer. 
        That company is also working with AI based mobile applications and I take responsibilities on quantization of PyTorch models to run them on mobile phones, 
        face frontalization, image animation and background removal models.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nowadays, I improve myself on MLOps with Coursera's MLOps Specialization and I want to continue to improve myself by working with you. 
        <br>
        Thank you for your time.
        <br>
        Have a nice day.
    </p>
